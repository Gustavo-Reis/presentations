						<h1>OpenGL</h1>
						<p class="fragment">OpenGLÂ® is the most widely adopted 2D and 3D graphics API in the industry, bringing thousands of applications to a wide variety of computer platforms.</p>
						<p class="fragment">It is window-system and operating-system independent as well as network-transparent.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h1>OpenGL</h1>
						<p class="fragment">OpenGL enables developers of software for PC, workstation, and supercomputing hardware to create high-performance, visually compelling graphics software applications, in markets such as CAD, content creation, energy, entertainment, game development, manufacturing, medical, and virtual reality.</p>
						<p class="fragment">OpenGL exposes all the features of the latest graphics hardware.</p>

						<h3>Core-profile vs Immediate Mode</h2>
						<p class="fragment">In the old days, using OpenGL meant developing in immediate mode (often referred to as the fixed function pipeline) which was an easy-to-use method for drawing graphics.</p>
						<p class="fragment">Most of the functionality of OpenGL was hidden in the library and developers did not have much freedom at how OpenGL does its calculations.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Core-profile vs Immediate Mode</h2>
						<p class="fragment">Developers eventually got hungry for more flexibility and over time the specifications became more flexible; developers gained more control over their graphics.</p>
						<p class="fragment">The immediate mode is really easy to use and understand, but it is also extremely inefficient.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p class="fragment">For that reason the specification started to deprecate immediate mode functionality from version 3.2 and started motivating developers to develop in OpenGL's core-profile mode which is a division of OpenGL's specification that removed all old deprecated functionality.</p>
						<p class="fragment">When using OpenGL's core-profile, OpenGL forces us to use modern practices. Whenever we try to use one of OpenGL's deprecated functions, OpenGL raises an error and stops drawing.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p class="fragment">The advantage of learning the modern approach is that it is very flexible and efficient, but unfortunately is also more difficult to learn.</p>
						<p class="fragment">The immediate mode abstracted quite a lot from the actual operations OpenGL performed and while it was easy to learn, it was hard to grasp how OpenGL actually operates.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p class="fragment">The modern approach requires the developer to truly understand OpenGL and graphics programming and while it is a bit difficult, it allows for much more flexibility, more efficiency and most importantly a much better understanding of graphics programming.</p>
						<p class="fragment">This is also the reason why our classes are geared at CoreProfile OpenGL version 3.3. Although it is more difficult, it is greatly worth the effort.</p>

						<h2>Creating a Window and an OpenGL Context</h2>
						<p class="fragment">Before you can start drawing things, you need to initialize OpenGL.</p>
						<p class="fragment">This is done by creating an OpenGL context, which is essentially a state machine that stores all data related to the rendering of your application.</p>
						<p class="fragment">When your application closes, the OpenGL context is destroyed and everything is cleaned up.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p class="fragment">The problem is that creating a window and an OpenGL context is not part of the OpenGL specification.</p>
						<p class="fragment">That means it is done differently on every platform out there!</p>
						<p class="fragment">Developing applications using OpenGL is all about being portable, so this is the last thing we need.</p>
						<p class="fragment">Luckily there are libraries out there that abstract this process, so that you can maintain the same codebase for all supported platforms.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p class="fragment">While the available libraries out there all have advantages and disadvantages, they do all have a certain program flow in common.</p>
						<p class="fragment">You start by specifying the properties of the game window, such as the title and the size and the properties of the OpenGL context, like the anti-aliasing level.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p class="fragment">Your application will then initiate the event loop, which contains an important set of tasks that need to be completed over and over again until the window closes.</p>
						<p class="fragment">These tasks usually handle window events like mouse clicks, updating the rendering state and then drawing.</p>

						<h3>GLAD</h3>
						<p class="fragment">We're still not quite there yet, since there is one other thing we still need to do.</p>
						<p class="fragment">Since OpenGL is a standard/specification it is up to the driver manufacturer to implement the specification to a driver that the specific graphics card supports.</p>
						<p class="fragment">Since there are many different versions of OpenGL drivers, the location of most of its functions is not known at compile-time and needs to be queried at run-time.</p>
					</section>

						<p class="fragment">It is then the task of the developer to retrieve the location of the functions he needs and store them in function pointers for later use.</p>

						<p class="fragment">GLAD has a slightly different configuration setup than most common open source libraries.</p>

						<h1>The Graphics Pipeline</h1>
					</section>
					<section>
						<img src="images/OpenGL/c2_pipeline.png" class="plain">
						<center><small>Image taken from: <a href="https://open.gl/drawing">https://open.gl/drawing</a></small></center>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Vertex Shader</h2>
						<p class="fragment">The vertex shader is a small program running on your graphics card that processes every one of these input vertices individually.</p>
						<p class="fragment">This is where the perspective transformation takes place, which projects vertices with a 3D world position onto your 2D screen!</p>
						<p class="fragment">It also passes important attributes like color and texture coordinates further down the pipeline.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p class="fragment">After the input vertices have been transformed, the graphics card will form triangles, lines or points out of them.</p>
						<p class="fragment">These shapes are called primitives because they form the basis of more complex shapes.</p>
						<p class="fragment">There are some additional drawing modes to choose from, like triangle strips and line strips.</p>
						<p class="fragment">These reduce the number of vertices you need to pass if you want to create objects where each next primitive is connected to the last one, like a continuous line consisting of several segments.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Geometry Shader</h2>
						<p class="fragment">The following step, the geometry shader, is completely optional and was only recently introduced.</p>
						<p class="fragment">Unlike the vertex shader, the geometry shader can output more data than comes in.</p>
						<p class="fragment">It takes the primitives from the shape assembly stage as input and can either pass a primitive through down to the rest of the pipeline, modify it first, completely discard it or even replace it with other primitive(s).</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p class="fragment">Since the communication between the GPU and the rest of the PC is relatively slow, this stage can help you reduce the amount of data that needs to be transferred.</p>
						<p class="fragment">With a voxel game for example, you could pass vertices as point vertices, along with an attribute for their world position, color and material and the actual cubes can be produced in the geometry shader with a point as input!</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Fragment Shader</h2>
						<p class="fragment">After the final list of shapes is composed and converted to screen coordinates, the rasterizer turns the visible parts of the shapes into pixel-sized fragments.</p>
						<p class="fragment">The vertex attributes coming from the vertex shader or geometry shader are interpolated and passed as input to the fragment shader for each fragment.</p>
						<p class="fragment">As you can see in the image, the colors are smoothly interpolated over the fragments that make up the triangle, even though only 3 points were specified.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p class="fragment">The fragment shader processes each individual fragment along with its interpolated attributes and should output the final color.</p>
						<p class="fragment">This is usually done by sampling from a texture using the interpolated texture coordinate vertex attributes or simply outputting a color.</p>
						<p class="fragment">In more advanced scenarios, there could also be calculations related to lighting and shadowing and special effects in this program.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p class="fragment">The shader also has the ability to discard certain fragments, which means that a shape will be see-through there.</p>
						<p class="fragment">Finally, the end result is composed from all these shape fragments by blending them together and performing <b>depth</b> and <b>stencil testing</b>.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p class="fragment">All you need to know about these last two right now, is that they allow you to use additional rules to throw away certain fragments and let others pass.</p>
						<p class="fragment">For example, if one triangle is obscured by another triangle, the fragment of the closer triangle should end up on the screen.</p>
					</section>
				</section>
				<section>
					<section>
						<h1>Hello Triangle</h1>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Vertex Input</h2>
						<p class="fragment">To start drawing something we have to first give OpenGL some input vertex data.</p>
						<p class="fragment">OpenGL is a 3D graphics library so all coordinates that we specify in OpenGL are in 3D (x, y and z coordinate).</p>
						<p class="fragment">OpenGL doesn't simply transform all your 3D coordinates to 2D pixels on your screen:</p>
						<ul class="fragment">
							<li>OpenGL only processes 3D coordinates when they're in a specific range between -1.0 and 1.0 on all 3 axes (x, y and z).</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p class="fragment">All coordinates within this so called normalized device coordinates range will end up visible on your screen (and all coordinates outside this region won't).</p>
						<p class="fragment">Because we want to render a single triangle we want to specify a total of three vertices with each vertex having a 3D position.</p>
						<p class="fragment">We define them in normalized device coordinates (the visible region of OpenGL) in a float array:</p>
						<pre  class="fragment"><code>float vertices[] = {
 0.0f,  0.5f, // Vertex 1 (X, Y)
 0.5f, -0.5f, // Vertex 2 (X, Y)
-0.5f, -0.5f  // Vertex 3 (X, Y)
};</code></pre>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Normalized Device Coordinates (NDC)</h2>
						<p class="fragment">Once your vertex coordinates have been processed in the vertex shader, they should be in normalized device coordinates which is a small space where the x, y and z values vary from -1.0 to 1.0.</p>
						<p class="fragment">Any coordinates that fall outside this range will be discarded/clipped and won't be visible on your screen.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p class="fragment">Below you can see the triangle we specified within normalized device coordinates (ignoring the z axis):</p>
						<p class="fragment"><img class ="plain" src="images/OpenGL/ndc.png" width="100%"></p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p class="fragment">With the vertex data defined we'd like to send it as input to the first process of the graphics pipeline: the vertex shader.</p>
						<p class="fragment">This is done by creating memory on the GPU where we store the vertex data, configure how OpenGL should interpret the memory and specify how to send the data to the graphics card.</p>
						<p class="fragment">The vertex shader then processes as much vertices as we tell it to from its memory.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p class="fragment">We manage this memory via so called vertex buffer objects (VBO) that can store a large number of vertices in the GPU's memory.</p>
						<p class="fragment">The advantage of using those buffer objects is that we can send large batches of data all at once to the graphics card without having to send data a vertex a time.</p>
						<p class="fragment">Sending data to the graphics card from the CPU is relatively slow, so wherever we can we try to send as much data as possible at once.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p class="fragment">Once the data is in the graphics card's memory the vertex shader has almost instant access to the vertices making it extremely fast.</p>
						<p class="fragment">A vertex buffer object is our first occurrence of an OpenGL object.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p class="fragment">Just like any object in OpenGL this buffer has a unique ID corresponding to that buffer, so we can generate one with a buffer ID using the glGenBuffers function:</p>
						<pre class="fragment"><code>GLuint vbo;
glGenBuffers(1, &vbo); // Generate 1 buffer</code></pre>
						<p class="fragment">or</p>
						<pre class="fragment"><code>unsigned int vbo;
glGenBuffers(1, &vbo); // Generate 1 buffer</code></pre>
					</section>
					<section><pre><code>GLuint vbo;
glGenBuffers(1, &vbo); // Generate 1 buffer</code></pre>
						<p class="fragment">The memory is managed by OpenGL, so instead of a pointer you get a positive number as a reference to it.</p>
						<p class="fragment"><code>GLuint</code> is simply a cross-platform substitute for <code>unsigned int</code>, just like <code>GLint</code> is one for <code>int</code>.</p>
						<p class="fragment">You will need this number to make the VBO active and to destroy it when you're done with it.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p class="fragment">OpenGL has many types of buffer objects and the buffer type of a vertex buffer object is <code>GL_ARRAY_BUFFER</code>.</p>
						<p class="fragment">OpenGL allows us to bind to several buffers at once as long as they have a different buffer type.</p>
						<p class="fragment">We can bind the newly created buffer to the <code>GL_ARRAY_BUFFER</code> target with the <code>glBindBuffer</code> function:</p>
						<pre class="fragment"><code>glBindBuffer(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, vbo);</code></pre>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p class="fragment">From that point on any buffer calls we make (on the <code>GL_ARRAY_BUFFER</code> target) will be used to configure the currently bound buffer, which is <code>vbo</code>.</p>
						<p class="fragment">Then we can make a call to <code>glBufferData</code> function that copies the previously defined vertex data into the buffer's memory:</p>
						<pre class="fragment"><code>glBufferData(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, sizeof(vertices), vertices, GL_STATIC_DRAW);</code></pre>
					</section>
					<section>
						<pre><code>glBufferData(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, sizeof(vertices), vertices, GL_STATIC_DRAW);</code></pre>
						<p class="fragment"><code>glBufferData</code> is a function specifically targeted to copy user-defined data into the currently bound buffer.</p>
						<p class="fragment">Its first argument is the type of the buffer we want to copy data into: the vertex buffer object currently bound to the <code>GL_ARRAY_BUFFER</code> target.</p>
						<p class="fragment">The second argument specifies the size of the data (in bytes) we want to pass to the buffer; a simple <code>sizeof</code> of the vertex data suffices.</p>
						<p class="fragment">The third parameter is the actual data we want to send.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<pre><code>glBufferData(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, sizeof(vertices), vertices, GL_STATIC_DRAW);</code></pre>
						<p class="fragment">The fourth parameter specifies how we want the graphics card to manage the given data. This can take 3 forms:</p>
						<ul class="fragment">
							<li><code>GL_STATIC_DRAW</code>: the data will most likely not change at all or very rarely.</li>
							<li><code>GL_DYNAMIC_DRAW</code>: the data is likely to change a lot.</li>
							<li><code>GL_STREAM_DRAW</code>: the data will change every time it is drawn.</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p class="fragment">The position data of the triangle does not change and stays the same for every render call so its usage type should best be <code>GL_STATIC_DRAW</code>.</p>
						<p class="fragment">If, for instance, one would have a buffer with data that is likely to change frequently, a usage type of <code>GL_DYNAMIC_DRAW</code> or <code>GL_STREAM_DRAW</code> ensures the graphics card will place the data in memory that allows for faster writes.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p class="fragment">As of now we stored the vertex data within memory on the graphics card as managed by a vertex buffer object named <code>vbo</code>.</p>
						<p class="fragment">Next we want to create a vertex and fragment shader that actually processes this data.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Vertex Shader</h2>
						<p class="fragment">The vertex shader is a program on the graphics card that processes each vertex and its attributes as they appear in the vertex array.</p>
						<p class="fragment">Its duty is to output the final vertex position in device coordinates and to output any data the fragment shader requires.</p>
						<p class="fragment">That's why the 3D transformation should take place here.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p class="fragment">The fragment shader depends on attributes like the color and texture coordinates, which will usually be passed from input to output without any calculations.</p>
						<p class="fragment">Since our vertex position is already specified as device coordinates and no other attributes exist, the vertex shader will be quite simple:</p>
						<pre class="fragment"><code>#version 330 core
layout (location = 0) in vec2 position;
void main()
{
	gl_Position = vec4(position, 0.0, 1.0);
}</code></pre>
					</section>
					<section><pre><code>#version 330 core
layout (location = 0) in vec2 position;
void main()
{
	gl_Position = vec4(position, 0.0, 1.0);
}</code></pre>
						<p class="fragment">As you can see, GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language) looks similar to C.</p>
						<p class="fragment">Each shader begins with a declaration of its version.</p>
						<p class="fragment">Since OpenGL 3.3 and higher the version numbers of GLSL match the version of OpenGL (GLSL version 420 corresponds to OpenGL version 4.2 for example).</p>
					</section>
					<section><pre><code>#version 330 core
layout (location = 0) in vec2 position;
void main()
{
	gl_Position = vec4(position, 0.0, 1.0);
}</code></pre>
						<p class="fragment">Next, we declare all the input vertex attributes in the vertex shader with the in keyword.</p>
						<p class="fragment">Right now we only care about position data so we only need a single vertex attribute.</p>
						<p class="fragment">GLSL has a vector datatype that contains 1 to 4 floats based on its postfix digit.</p>
					</section>
					<section><pre><code>#version 330 core
layout (location = 0) in vec2 position;
void main()
{
	gl_Position = vec4(position, 0.0, 1.0);
}</code></pre>
						<p class="fragment">Since each vertex has a 2D coordinate we create a <code>vec2</code> input variable with the name <code>position</code>.</p>
						<p class="fragment">We also specifically set the location of the input variable via <code>layout (location = 0)</code> and you'll later see that why we're going to need that location.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p class="fragment">Apart from the regular C types, GLSL has built-in vector and matrix types identified by <code>vec</code>* and <code>mat</code>* identifiers.</p>
						<p class="fragment">The type of the values within these constructs is always a <code>float</code>.</p>
						<p class="fragment">The number after vec specifies the number of components (x, y, z, w) and the number after <code>mat</code> specifies the number of rows /columns.</p>
						<p class="fragment">Since the position attribute consists of only an X and Y coordinate, <code>vec2</code> is perfect.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p class="fragment">You can be quite creative when working with these vertex types. In the example above a shortcut was used to set the first two components of the <code>vec4</code> to those of <code>vec2</code>.</p>
						<p class="fragment">These two lines are equal:</p>
						<pre class="fragment"><code>gl_Position = vec4(position, 0.0, 1.0);
gl_Position = vec4(position.x, position.y, 0.0, 1.0);</code></pre>
						<p class="fragment">When you're working with colors, you can also access the individual components with r, g, b and a instead of x, y, z and w.</p>
						<p class="fragment">This makes no difference and can help with clarity.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p class="fragment">The final position of the vertex is assigned to the special <code>gl_Position</code> variable, because the position is needed for primitive assembly and many other built-in processes.</p>
						<p class="fragment">For these to function correctly, the last value <code>w</code> needs to have a value of <code>1.0f</code></p>
						<p class="fragment">Other than that, you're free to do anything you want with the attributes and we'll see how to output those when we add color to the triangle later on.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Fragment Shader</h2>
						<p class="fragment">The output from the vertex shader is interpolated over all the pixels on the screen covered by a primitive.â</p>
						<p class="fragment">These pixels are called fragments and this is what the fragment shader operates on.â</p>
						<p class="fragment">Just like the vertex shader it has one mandatory output, the final color of a fragment.â</p>
						<p class="fragment">It's up to you to write the code for computing this color from vertex colors, texture coordinates and any other data coming from the vertex shader.â</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p class="fragment">To keep things simple the fragment shader will always output an orange-ish color:â</p>
						<pre class="fragment"><code>#version 330 core
out vec4 outColor;

void main()
{
	outColor = vec4(1.0f, 0.5f, 0.2f, 1.0f);

						<h3>Compiling Shaders</h3>
						<p class="fragment">Compiling shaders is easy once you have loaded the source code (either from file or as a hard-coded string).</p>
						<p class="fragment">You can easily include your shader source in the C++ code through C++11 raw string literals:</p>
						<pre class = "fragment"><code>const char* vertexShaderSource = R"glsl(
#version 330 core

in vec2 position;

void main()
{
    gl_Position = vec4(position, 0.0, 1.0);
}
)glsl";</code></pre>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p class="fragment">We wrote the source code for the vertex shader (stored in a C string), but in order for OpenGL to use the shader it has to dynamically compile it at run-time from its source code.</p>
						<p class="fragment">The first thing we need to do is create a shader object, again referenced by an ID. So we store the vertex shader as an unsigned int and create the shader with <code>glCreateShader</code>:</p>
						<pre class="fragment"><code>GLuint vertexShader = glCreateShader(GL_VERTEX_SHADER);
glShaderSource(vertexShader, 1, &vertexShaderSource, NULL);
</code></pre>
					</section>
					<section>
						<pre><code>GLuint vertexShader = glCreateShader(GL_VERTEX_SHADER);
glShaderSource(vertexShader, 1, &vertexShaderSource, NULL);
</code></pre>			
						<p class="fragment">We provide the type of shader we want to create as an argument to <code>glCreateShader</code>. Since we're creating a vertex shader we pass in <code>GL_VERTEX_SHADER</code>.</p>
						<p class="fragment">Next we attach the shader source code to the shader object and compile the shader:</p>
						<pre class="fragment"><code>glShaderSource(vertexShader, 1, &vertexShaderSource, NULL);
glCompileShader(vertexShader);
</code></pre>
					</section>
					<section>
						<pre><code>glShaderSource(vertexShader, 1, &vertexShaderSource, NULL);
glCompileShader(vertexShader);
</code></pre>
						<p class="fragment">The <code>glShaderSource</code> function takes the shader object to compile to as its first argument.</p>
						<p class="fragment">The second argument specifies how many strings we're passing as source code, which is only one.</p>
						<p class="fragment">The third parameter is the actual source code of the vertex shader and we can leave the 4th parameter to <code>NULL</code>.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p class="fragment">You probably want to check if compilation was successful after the call to glCompileShader and if not, what errors were found so you can fix those.</p>
						<p class="fragment">Checking for compile-time errors is accomplished as follows:</p>
						<pre class="fragment"><code>GLint  success;
char infoLog[512];
glGetShaderiv(vertexShader, GL_COMPILE_STATUS, &success);</code></pre>
						<p class="fragment">First we define an integer to indicate success and a storage container for the error messages (if any).</p>

						<p class="fragment">If compilation failed, we should retrieve the error message with glGetShaderInfoLog and print the error message.</p>
						<pre class="fragment"><code>if(!success)

						<p class="fragment">A shader program object is the final linked version of multiple shaders combined.</p>

						<p class="fragment">The activated shader program's shaders will be used when we issue render calls.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<pre class="fragment"><code>GLuint shaderProgram;
shaderProgram = glCreateProgram();</code></pre>
						<p class="fragment">The <code>glCreateProgram</code> function creates a program and returns the ID reference to the newly created program object.</p>

						<pre class="fragment"><code>glAttachShader(shaderProgram, vertexShader);
glAttachShader(shaderProgram, fragmentShader);
glLinkProgram(shaderProgram);</code></pre>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p class="fragment">Just like shader compilation we can also check if linking a shader program failed and retrieve the corresponding log.</p>

						<pre class="fragment"><code>glGetProgramiv(shaderProgram, GL_LINK_STATUS, &success);
if(!success) {
    glGetProgramInfoLog(shaderProgram, 512, NULL, infoLog);
    std::cout << "ERROR::SHADER::PROGRAM::COMPILATION_FAILED\n" << infoLog << std::endl;

						<p class="fragment">The result is a program object that we can activate by calling <code>glUseProgram</code> with the newly created program object as its argument:</p>
						<pre class="fragment"><code>glUseProgram(shaderProgram);</code></pre>
						<p class="fragment">Every shader and rendering call after glUseProgram will now use this program object (and thus the shaders).</p>
						<p class="fragment">Next, delete the shader objects once we've linked them into the program object; we no longer need them anymore:</p>
						<pre class="fragment"><code>glDeleteShader(vertexShader);
glDeleteShader(fragmentShader);</code></pre>
					</section>

						<p class="fragment">Right now we sent the input vertex data to the GPU and instructed the GPU how it should process the vertex data within a vertex and fragment shader.</p>

						<h3>Linking Vertex Attributes</h3>
						<p class="fragment">The vertex shader allows us to specify any input we want in the form of vertex attributes and while this allows for great flexibility, it does mean we have to manually specify what part of our input data goes to which vertex attribute in the vertex shader.</p>

						<p class="fragment">Also, just like the VBO we want to place those calls between a bind and an unbind call, although this time we specify GL_ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER as the buffer type.</p>
						<pre class="fragment"><code>glBindBuffer(GL_ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER, ebo);
glBufferData(GL_ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER, sizeof(indices), indices, GL_STATIC_DRAW);</code></pre>
						<p class="fragment">Note that we're now giving <code>GL_ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER</code> as the buffer target.</p>
						<p class="fragment">The last thing left to do is replace the <code>glDrawArrays</code> call with <code>glDrawElements</code> to indicate we want to render the triangles from an index buffer.</p>

						<p class="fragment">When using glDrawElements we're going to draw using indices provided in the element buffer object currently bound:</p>
						<pre class="fragment"><code>glBindBuffer(GL_ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER, ebo);
glDrawElements(GL_TRIANGLES, 6, GL_UNSIGNED_INT, 0);</code></pre>
						<p class="fragment">The first argument specifies the mode we want to draw in, similar to <code>glDrawArrays</code>.</p>
						<p class="fragment">The second argument is the count or number of elements we'd like to draw.</p>
						<p class="fragment">We specified <code>6</code> indices so we want to draw <code>6</code> vertices in total.</p>
						<p class="fragment">The third argument is the type of the indices which is of type <code>GL_UNSIGNED_INT</code>.</p>

						<pre><code>glBindBuffer(GL_ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER, ebo);
glDrawElements(GL_TRIANGLES, 6, GL_UNSIGNED_INT, 0);</code></pre>
						<p class="fragment">The last argument allows us to specify an offset in the EBO (or pass in an index array, but that is when you're not using element buffer objects), but we're just going to leave this at <code>0</code>.</p>
						<p class="fragment">The <code>glDrawElements</code> function takes its indices from the EBO currently bound to the <code>GL_ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER</code> target.</p>
						<p class="fragment">This means we have to bind the corresponding EBO each time we want to render an object with indices which seems again a bit cumbersome.</p>

						<p class="fragment">It just so happens that a vertex array object also keeps track of element buffer object bindings.</p>
						<p class="fragment">The element buffer object currently bound while a VAO is bound, is stored as the VAO's element buffer object.</p>
						<p class="fragment">Binding to a VAO thus also automatically binds its EBO.</p>
