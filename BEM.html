                	<h2>Green's function</h2>
                	<p class="fragment">The Green’s function is the fundamental solution to the inhomogeneous acoustic wave equation and the Helmholtz equation for a point source, which satisfies the boundary condition of the impedance surface.</p>
                	<p class="fragment">Physically, it is the impulse response of a system caused by the application of a unit point source.</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                	<p class="fragment">In terms of sound propagation, it represents the propagation of sound from the source to the receiver in an acoustic medium, which can either be air or water.</p>
                	<p class="fragment">The Green’s functions equally represent the fundamental acoustic pressure at a measuring point in an acoustic domain, which is exerted by an acoustic source located at different points within the same domain.</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                	<p class="fragment">Once the Green’s function which satisfies a specific boundary condition is known, the pressure level at any other point except at the source point (to avoid singularity) can easily be calculated.</p>
                	<p class="fragment">The Green’s functions are utilized in Boundary Element Method (BEM), in beamforming, in Near-field Acoustic Holography (NAH),in duct acoustic, etc. </p>
                </section>
                <section>
                	<p class="fragment">In solving problems in radiation and scattering, Green’s functions provide a concise mathematical expression, which eases the computation of such problems.</p>
                	<p class="fragment">In any acoustic system, the Green’s function relates the source (cause) and the response (effect) for that system.</p>

                <section>
                	<h2>Reciprocity property</h2>
                	<p class="fragment">This property implies that the Green's function obtained for a source positioned at $\textbf{y}$ and the observer at $\textbf{x}$, is the same when the two locations are switched.</p>
                	<p class="fragment">It is also referred to as the symmetry property between a source point and the observation point in a sound field.</p>
                	<p class="fragment">The sound pressure level measured when an observer is located at point $\textbf{x}$ and source positioned at point $\textbf{y}$, is the same as when the observer is now positioned at $\textbf{y}$ and while the source is located at $\textbf{x}$.</p>                	
                </section>
                <section>
                	<p class="fragment">This reciprocity property of the Green's function is denoted as:</p>
                	<p class="fragment">$$G(\textbf{x},t|\textbf{y},\tau) = G(\textbf{y},-\tau|\textbf{x},-t)$$</p>
                	<p class="fragment">where $G(\textbf{x},t|\textbf{y},\tau)$ is the time-domain Green's function, $\textbf{x}=(x,y,z)$ is the observer point, $\textbf{y}=(x_0,y_0,z_0)$ is the source point and while $t$ and $\tau$ are the time at the observer point and source point, respectively.</p>

                	<h2>Boundary conditions</h2>
                	<p class="fragment">In mathematics, in the field of differential equations, a <b>boundary value problem</b> is a differential equation together with a set of additional constraints, called the <b>boundary conditions</b>.</p>
                	<p class="fragment">A solution to a boundary value problem is a solution to the differential equation which also satisfies the boundary conditions.</p>
                 </section>
                <section>
               	<p class="fragment">Boundary conditions are constraints on the domain boundary that must be satisfied for a specific solution to be obtained in any Boundary Value Problem (BVP).</p>
                	<p class="fragment">BVP of acoustic problems can be divided into two categories, namely, <b>interior</b> (finite) value problem and <b>exterior</b> (infinite) value problem.</p>
                </section>
                <section>                	
                	<p class="fragment">Interior value problems are sound problems within an enclosed domain, and its behavior can either be solved by an approach based on a differential equation or an integral equation.</p>

                	<p class="fragment">The radiation condition (<b>Sommerfeld radiation condition</b>) at infinity needs to be satisfied which is adverse to the approach based on a differential equation.</p>

                	<p class="fragment">Sommerfeld radiation condition is a criterion which ensures that every outgoing wave radiates to infinity and that no wave originating from infinity can move inwardly to the boundary surface for any exterior BVP.</p>
                	<p class="fragment">This is necessary because every solution to the Helmholtz equation must represent only outward sound propagation, as having an inward reflection from infinite will have no physical meaning.</p>
                	<p class="fragment">Thus, this criterion will lead to a well-posed problem and guarantee a unique solution.</p>

                	<p class="fragment">These boundary conditions are termed homogeneous boundary conditions when any of them is equal to zero on the body surface.</p>
                		<p class="fragment">If not, they are termed as the inhomogeneous boundary condition.</p>
                		<p class="fragment">Here, we will focus on homogenous boundary conditions, while the governing equation will be inhomogeneous, because whenever a source is present, either the governing equation or the boundary condition needs to be inhomogeneous in order to represent the problem.</p>
